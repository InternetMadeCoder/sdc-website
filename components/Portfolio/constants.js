The system uses a camera to capture the driverâ€™s face image and a machine learning model to analyze the eye movement of the driver. The system can detect whether the driver is drowsy or not based on the eye movement and alert the driver accordingly. The system also uses Firebase to enable user registration and login, and Core ML to integrate the machine learning model with the iOS application. The system can improve the safety and performance of the driver and prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.',
